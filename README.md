# Speaker Bureau Site for Doctors for America

This site will help staff to manage speaking requests.
Allowing them to match up a speaker to the event.
Overtime it will also help them to see long term trends.

ActiveAdmin is managing the content editing interface.
Thanks to railscast I was able to add a custom calendar.
An of course twitter bootstrap!

#TODO Items
Cache on the search page, figure out using params
More tests
 * Since I alter active admin I need to test that as well
Make the form more mobile friendly
